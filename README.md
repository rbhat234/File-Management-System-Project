# File-Management-System-Project
## INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT :
The Y.S.S Management System is based on automation of the information which provides necessary help to the Core members of the organization. Every year, many new youngsters join the organization and it is required to store their information and manage organizational needs. It is the first step of our project team to simplify the process of storing new members in an effective and efficient manner. In second step our project team’s aim is to simply the Accounts related information, whether in storing, retrieving and modifying the organizational data. In this project administrator(s) can Modify, Add, Search or Delete a record. With the advent of computers, manual database system is replaced by computerized database system. It combines features of both computer hardware and software that means when we install the software for database manipulation own to computer, we get the computerized database system. Administrator(s) can also add or search information related to new or existing member. Organization can generate a report of the members very easily. Organization can search the information of the members very easily. Moreover, the chances of errors are less. This project has been structured to provide efficiently in operation and easiness in handling of database. When any information of the member gets changed, we have to only insert the new information in the database, which otherwise create much problem and much effort. This project has been structured to provide efficiency in operation and easiness in handling of database. 
## Aim of the project:
* The Working of the System should be Easily Understandable. 
* The System should be fast &amp; easy to use. 
* The System Should be reliable. By reliable we mean that the results provided by the system should be accurate. 
* The system should be accessible from anywhere on the network.
## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
* WORKING OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM.
* WORKING OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM.

### WORKING OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM

#### EXISTING SYSTEM
* Every year, many youngsters joins Y.S.S Organization therefore organization requires to register those members and do other general tasks of maintenance of accounts. Then these functions are manually performed which enraptures a lot of manpower, time & other essential requirements.

* So it takes a lot of time in over all processing. Even manual searching & updation of the members record is very difficult & time consuming as one has to go through the whole records .The chances of errors in the data base are more especially when the information of any member gets changed or accounts related information is updated. In short, it is really time consuming and enraptures a lot of manpower. Since all the work is done manually so it has some flaws.

#### DRAWBACKS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM

##### DATA STORAGE AND ACCESS
* Sometimes add new records is in abundant. It becomes difficult to store all the information, all the received application forms. So, data Storage becomes difficult, as the size of data grows large. As a result, access of data is a time consuming and error prone task.

##### TIME CONSUMING
* A lot of time is wasted while maintaining the records and it requires a lot of manual efforts. In order to search a particular record, the administrators has to go through all the records.

##### PROBLEM IN THE UPDATED INFORMATION
* If any information of the member gets changed, a new form has to be filled, which raises the cost of operation.

##### MORE ERROR PRONE
* The present manual system is more error prone due to the problems like loss of data, misplacement of records etc.

##### NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE
* The present System is not Easily Accessible as it is handled manually. Manual Checking of files is required to access the data which is both time consuming and cumbersome.
* In short, one can say that it is not an efficient and effective approach.

### WORKING OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM

#### PROPOSED SYSTEM
* Technology is used to make the problems simpler. The significance of the project lies in the utilization of the technology along with the power of computers to help the organization to get the work done efficiently and effectively. To overcome the above-mentioned Requirements this computerized Y.S.S Management system was proposed.

* In the Proposed System, the members of organization get electronically registered and if any information of the member gets changed, only the updation operation of the member record need to be performed.
* Administrator can view and update the details of the members, accounts related information if needed.
* He can also view all the details of members whenever he needs. Administrator can view all the information of the members of the organization.
* The Administrator has the facility to view as well as delete the information of any member. He also has the facility to update the new details of the members. Moreover he has the control over what, when and why changes are made by the Accountant, Cashier.  
* The administrator also has the privilege to upload the pictures, view the picture details as well as delete the picture, details. Pictures are always related to organization. Only registered administrator has privilege to view the picture.
* The Accountant has the facility to check the finical needs of the organization and maintain the accounting database, moreover he has the overall hold on the finical consideration of the organization.
* The Cashier is responsible for the maintaining the database of the transactions (credits/debits) of the organization. His main function is to generate receipt for cash contributed to the organization and expenses by the organization.  

#### BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM: -

* The various benefits of the proposed System are:
* More users friendly and interactive.
* Simple and easy to use.
* The Administrator(s) gets the updated information on time.
* Information can be kept for a longer time for the future needs.
* Considerable amount of time can be saved.
* No manual work is done which leads to less error prone system.
* Any Information can be modified if required.
* If the Administrator(s) has any doubts, he can check the records anytime.
* Searching of any record of the members can be done very easily.

## PROJECT MODULE.
### 	DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT MODULES OF THE SYSTEM
* The software has been designed in a modular manner. There is a separate module for every function of the System. The Proposed system was very large in size due to various different and completely independent tasks the system had to perform, so different modules were identified and then the system was developed. The various modules of the system are shown on the next page:
